# AI Coder V3: High-Level Architecture & Design

## Overview

AI Coder V3 is an intelligent development assistant that bridges traditional command-line interfaces with modern AI capabilities. The system provides **two distinct interaction modes** while sharing a common AI agent core, creating a seamless development experience that adapts to user preferences and contexts.

## Core Innovation: Dual Interface Architecture

### The Problem
Traditional AI assistants require explicit activation and mode switching. Users must decide upfront whether they want to:
- Execute shell commands directly
- Ask an AI for help
- Get AI assistance with command-line tasks

This creates cognitive overhead and breaks workflow continuity.

### The Solution: Intelligent Routing

AI Coder V3 introduces **transparent AI integration** through intelligent input classification, allowing users to seamlessly mix shell commands and natural language without explicit mode switching.

## Interface Modes

### 1. Traditional Agent Interface (`./aida`)

**Philosophy**: Explicit AI conversation mode
**Use Case**: Focused development tasks, code analysis, planning

**Characteristics**:
- Direct LLM conversation
- Explicit tool usage
- Rich context modes (none/AST/RAG)
- Session-based interaction
- Full event tracing

**Flow**:
```
User Input → Agent Core → Tool Selection → Execution → Response
```

### 2. AI Shell Interface (`aida-shell`)

**Philosophy**: Transparent AI-enhanced shell
**Use Case**: Daily command-line work with AI assistance

**Innovation**: **Three-Tier Classification System**

#### Tier 1: Heuristic Classification (90% of inputs, 0 API calls)
```python
# Instant classification without AI
"ls -la"           → Command (execute directly)
"what files here?" → Natural Language (route to AI)
```

#### Tier 2: AI Classification (10% of inputs, GPT-4.1 Mini)
```python
# Ambiguous cases need AI decision
"show logs"        → AI classifies → Route accordingly
"restart server"   → AI classifies → Route accordingly
```

#### Tier 3: Agent Processing (Natural Language only, GPT-5 Mini)
```python
# Full AI processing with tools and context
"fix the last error" → Agent + Command History → Tool Execution
```

**Flow**:
```
User Input → Classification → [Command Execution | AI Processing] → Response
```

## Key Innovations

### 1. Intelligent Command Classification

**The Challenge**: Distinguishing between shell commands and natural language in real-time.

**Innovation**: Hybrid classification using heuristics + AI function calling.

**Special Handling Example**:
```python
# Smart "find" disambiguation
"find . -name '*.py'"     → Command (has command patterns)
"find the project folder" → Natural Language (has article "the")
```

**Cost Optimization**: 90% of inputs classified instantly without API calls.

### 2. SSH-to-Localhost Execution

**The Challenge**: AI-suggested commands need to execute in the user's actual shell environment, not isolated subprocesses.

**Failed Approaches**:
- `subprocess.run()` - isolated environment
- Shell variable manipulation - limited scope
- Process injection - security/complexity issues

**Innovation**: SSH to localhost for command execution.

**Why This Works**:
- Full environment access (not sandboxed)
- Proper stdio handling through established SSH framework
- Natural handling of interactive commands
- Existing authentication and security model

**Implementation**:
```python
def execute_command(self, command):
    stdin, stdout, stderr = self.ssh.exec_command(command)
    return stdout.read(), stderr.read(), exit_code
```

### 3. State Preservation Across Contexts

**The Challenge**: Shell state (current directory, environment variables) must persist across different execution contexts.

**Innovation**: Multi-layered state synchronization:

1. **Stateful Commands**: Special handling for `cd`, `export`, etc.
2. **File-based State Changes**: Use shell sourcing for state persistence
3. **Context Synchronization**: Keep Python process and SSH session in sync

**Example**:
```bash
$ cd /tmp                    # Changes directory in all contexts
$ pwd                        # Shows /tmp (state preserved)
$ what directory am I in?    # AI knows current directory is /tmp
```

### 4. Command History Integration

**The Challenge**: AI needs context about recent commands and their outcomes for intelligent assistance.

**Innovation**: Shared command history between direct execution and AI tool usage.

**Implementation**:
- Custom `AIShellToolExecutor` that tracks all command executions
- Command history includes: command, output, exit code, directory, timestamp
- AI receives recent history as context for natural language queries

**Example Flow**:
```bash
$ git push origin main
fatal: repository not found
$ what went wrong?           # AI sees the failed git command and error
🤖 The repository URL is incorrect or you don't have access...
```

### 5. Model Optimization Strategy

**Innovation**: Different models for different cognitive loads.

**Cost-Optimized Model Selection**:
- **GPT-4.1 Mini**: Fast classification decisions (cheap, fast)
- **GPT-5 Mini**: Complex reasoning and tool usage (expensive, powerful)

**Result**: Intelligent routing minimizes expensive model usage while maintaining quality.

---

## Technical Deep Dives

### Classification System Quirks

**Problem**: Edge cases in command vs natural language detection.

**Examples**:
- `"list the files"` vs `"ls"` - both want file listing
- `"find the folder"` vs `"find . -name folder"` - different intents
- `"run tests"` vs `"pytest"` - same goal, different expression

**Solution**: Context-aware classification with command history.

### State Management Complexity

**Challenge**: Three separate execution contexts must stay synchronized:
1. Python process (for shell features)
2. SSH session (for command execution)
3. User's mental model (current directory, environment)

**Edge Cases**:
- SSH directory doesn't exist locally (network mounts)
- Environment variables differ between contexts
- Interactive commands that change terminal state

**Handling**:
```python
def sync_directories(self):
    ssh_pwd = self.ssh_execute("pwd").strip()
    if ssh_pwd != self.python_cwd:
        try:
            os.chdir(ssh_pwd)
            self.python_cwd = ssh_pwd
        except OSError:
            # Handle mismatch gracefully
            self._warn_directory_mismatch()
```

### Tool Result Interpretation

**Problem**: Silent commands (like `mkdir`) provide no feedback to AI.

**Original Issue**:
```
Agent: *runs mkdir command*
Tool Result: "Return Code: 0"
Agent: "I don't know if the folder was created..."
```

**Solution**: Enhanced tool result formatting:
```
✅ COMMAND SUCCEEDED
OUTPUT: (no output - command completed silently)
Exit Code: 0
```

**Result**: AI understands command success/failure clearly.

## System Quirks & Gotchas

### 1. The "Loaded 0 tools" Red Herring

**What Users See**:
```
🤖 Initializing AI Shell...
Loaded 0 tools: 
✅ AI Shell ready!
```

**What's Actually Happening**:
- ToolExecutor finds 0 Python command files (path issue)
- Agent loads 6 tools from tools.yaml (working fine)
- System functions normally despite misleading message

**Why We Don't Fix It**: The message is cosmetic; functionality is unaffected.

### 2. Directory Context Switching

**Behavior**: AI Shell remembers your directory when you switch between different terminal sessions.

**Implementation**: Each AI Shell instance tracks its own directory state independently of the system shell.

**User Impact**: Consistent experience across different terminal windows.

### 3. Classification Cache Behavior

**Optimization**: Recent classifications are cached to avoid repeated API calls.

**Quirk**: Identical inputs get cached responses, which can seem "too fast" to users expecting AI processing time.

**Benefit**: Significant cost savings on repeated patterns.

### 4. SSH Authentication Assumptions

**Requirement**: AI Shell assumes SSH key-based authentication to localhost.

**Setup Complexity**: First-time setup requires SSH key generation and configuration.

**Fallback**: Graceful degradation to local subprocess execution if SSH unavailable.

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency Profile

**Instant Response** (0-50ms):
- Heuristic command classification
- Direct command execution
- Cached classifications

**Fast Response** (100-500ms):
- GPT-4.1 classification calls
- Simple AI responses without tools

**Standard Response** (1-3 seconds):
- GPT-5 processing with tools
- Complex command sequences
- File operations and analysis

**Slow Response** (3+ seconds):
- RAG-enabled queries
- Large file processing
- Complex multi-step tasks

### Cost Optimization

**Daily Usage Pattern** (estimated):
- 70% heuristic classification (free)
- 20% GPT-4.1 classification (~$0.01/1000 calls)
- 10% GPT-5 full processing (~$0.10/1000 calls)

**Result**: ~90% cost reduction compared to routing everything through GPT-5.

**Implementation**: Preserve familiar shell features (history, tab completion, signals) while adding AI capabilities.

### 2. Transparent AI is Better Than Explicit AI

**Learning**: Users prefer seamless AI integration over explicit AI activation.

**Evidence**: AI Shell adoption higher than traditional agent usage for daily tasks.

### 3. Context is Everything

**Learning**: AI assistance quality directly correlates with available context.

**Implementation**: Aggressive context collection (command history, directory state, error messages) significantly improves AI responses.

### 4. Performance Perception vs Reality

**Learning**: Users perceive AI performance based on the slowest interaction, not average performance.

**Solution**: Optimize for worst-case scenarios and provide clear feedback during processing.
