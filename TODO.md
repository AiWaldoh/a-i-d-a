## üß¨ Meta-Agent Architecture

### "Brain" Agent Design
- **Concept**: Higher-level agent that observes and adjusts the basic agent
- **Capabilities**:
  - Monitor task performance in real-time
  - Dynamically adjust strategy based on progress
  - Modify prompts and context as needed
  - Act as a meta-cognitive layer above the ReAct loop

## üîç Security Research Tools

### Exploit Database Search Tool
- **File**: `src/commands/exploitdb_search.py`
- **Purpose**: Search exploit-db.com for vulnerabilities and exploits
- **Features**:
  - Search by software name, version, CVE
  - Return exploit details and references
  - Parse exploit metadata

### Google Dork Search Tool
- **File**: `src/commands/google_dork.py`
- **Purpose**: Execute Google dork queries for security research
- **Features**:
  - Support advanced Google operators (site:, filetype:, intitle:, etc.)
  - Handle authentication/cookies like google_search tool
  - Return targeted results for security research

  <you need an agent to look at the tool call results after a sequence has been made (you do 3x read websites then it goes to run_command, so after>
  <the 3x, you have the brain llm ask if its enough info or if it needs to call more tools for more info (1 turn max) )>
