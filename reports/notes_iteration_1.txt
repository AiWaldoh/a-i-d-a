HackTheBox Target: 10.10.11.87
Date: 2025-10-02
Iteration: 1/50

Summary:
- Initial TCP connect scan (non-root) completed.

Open Ports:
- 22/tcp open (ssh)

Services/Versions:
- SSH: OpenSSH 10.0p2 Debian 8 (protocol 2.0) [Nmap 7.80 fingerprint]
  - Note: Version/OS fingerprint may be inaccurate; Debian 8 typically shipped older OpenSSH. Treat with caution.

Vulnerabilities/Issues (Preliminary):
- Only SSH exposed. No obvious remote unauthenticated vector identified yet.
- Potential for username/password or key-based auth required. Direct SSH brute-force typically out-of-scope for HTB unless indicated by clues.

Important Discoveries:
- None (no creds/endpoints yet).

Gaps / Next Steps:
- Re-run a slower, thorough full TCP scan to catch any rate-limited or high-latency ports that may have been missed by a fast scan.
- Enumerate UDP top ports to identify additional services.
- If still only SSH, look for alternative vectors: IPv6, vhosts via TLS SNI (needs HTTPS), or staging through UDP.

Planned Commands:
- TCP (slow thorough): nmap -sT -p- -T3 --defeat-rst-ratelimit --max-retries 2 --min-rate 1000 -sV -sC -Pn 10.10.11.87 -oA scans/nmap_full_tcp_slow
- UDP (top ports): nmap -sU --top-ports 200 -sV -Pn 10.10.11.87 -oA scans/nmap_top200_udp
